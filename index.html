								            <h2>Publications</h2>
								        </header>
								        <p>I've published over <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/au:+barclay_t/0/1/0/2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023,2024,2025/0/1?per_page=1000">110 refereed papers</a>, on all manner of topics in astrophysics ranging from planets in our solar system to distant supernovae. Below are a list of papers that I've been a part and am especially proud of, or I think are particularly interesting for one reason or another.</p>
													<dl>
														<dt>The L 98-59 System: Three Transiting, Terrestrial-Sized Planets Orbiting a Nearby M-dwarf</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>We reported the discovery of three terrestrial-sized planets transiting L 98-59, a bright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. The planets radii range from 0.7 REarth to 1.3 REarth. The planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190308017K">(Kostov, Schlieder, Barclay et al. 2019, AJ)</a></p>
														</dd>
														<dt>A Revised Exoplanet Yield from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>We presented estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission would detect, the physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimated that TESS will find 1250 exoplanets, including 250 smaller than 2 earth-radii. Furthermore, we predicted that an additional 3100 planets would be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. The simulation data are available from <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Planet_and_host_star_properties/6137672">Figshare</a>. These simulations seems to have done a pretty good job. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..239....2B">(Barclay, Quintana and Pepper, 2018, ApJS)</a></p>
														</dd>
														<dt>The Demographics of Rocky Free-floating Planets and their Detectability by WFIRST</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>Planets form via accretion from a remnant disk around a newly formed star. During this process, material in the disk either remains bound to the star as part of either a planet, a smaller celestial body, or makes up part of the the interplanetary medium; falls into the star; or is ejected from the system. We used dynamical models to probe the abundance and properties of ejected material during late-stage planet formation and estimate their contribution to the free-floating planet population. We predicted that the space-borne microlensing search for free-floating planets from the Wide-Field Infra-Red Space Telescope will discover up to 15 Mars-mass planets, but few free-floating Earth-mass planets. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...841...86B">(Barclay, Quintana, Raymond and Penny, 2017, ApJ)</a></p>
														</dd>
														<dt>An Ancient Extrasolar System with Five Sub-Earth-size Planets</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>This is definitely my favorite planetary systems. We reported the discovery of five transiting planets with sizes between those of Mercury. The host star, Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected solar-like oscillations. We used asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of 11.2 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when the universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...799..170C">(Campante, Barclay, Swift et al., 2015, ApJ)</a></p>
														</dd>
														<dt>An Earth-Sized Planet in the Habitable Zone of a Cool Star</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>We presented the detection of Kepler-186f, a 1.1 Earth-radius planet that is the outermost of five planets, all roughly Earth-sized. The intensity and spectrum of the star’s radiation place Kepler-186f in the stellar habitable zone, implying that if Kepler-186f has an Earth-like atmosphere and water at its surface, then some of this water is likely to be in liquid form. This was the first Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone of another . <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Sci...344..277Q">(Quintana, Barclay, Raymond, et al., 2014, Science)</a></p>
														</dd>
														<dt>A sub-Mercury-sized exoplanet</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, it has been known that other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. Until fairly recently, we have been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution. Here we reported a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. This tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the Sun-like host star, which we have designated Kepler-37. Owing to its extremely small size, similar to that of the Moon, and highly irradiated surface, the planet, Kepler-37b, is probably rocky with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Natur.494..452B">(Barclay, Rowe, Lissauer, et al., 2013, Nature)</a></p>
